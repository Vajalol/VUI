  - VUIBuffs (from buff-overlay)
  - VUIAnyFrame (from MoveAny)
  - VUIKeystones (from Angry Keystones)
  - VUICC (from OmniCC)
  - VUICD (from OmniCD - Party Cooldown Tracker)
  - VUIIDs (from idTip)
  - VUIGfinder (from PremadeGroupFinder)
  - VUITGCD (from TrufiGCD)
  - VUIAuctionator (from Auctionator)
  - VUINotifications (from SpellNotifications)

### âœ… Phase 2: WeakAura Feature Replication
- Implemented all 5 required WeakAura-derived modules:
  - VUIConsumables (from Luxthos - Consumables)
  - VUIPositionOfPower (from Position of Power)
  - VUIMissingRaidBuffs (from Missing Raid Buffs)
  - VUIMouseFireTrail (from Frogski's mouse fire trail)
  - VUIHealerMana (from Healer Mana)

### âœ… Phase 3: VUI Plater
- Created comprehensive nameplate customization system
- Replicated Whiiskeyz Plater profile appearance and functionality
- Integrated all necessary textures and visuals
- Implemented dynamic nameplate behavior for different unit types

### âœ… Phase 4: UI/UX Unification and Configuration Panel
- Created enhanced configuration panel with organized categories
- Implemented Animation.lua utility for smooth transitions and effects
- Standardized media directory structure (using uppercase "Media")
- Consolidated all module configurations into unified panel
- Removed TestFramework.lua in favor of direct in-game debugging

## Priority Tasks - Configuration System Overhaul

### ðŸ”´ Phase 4.5: Configuration System Redesign
- **High Priority**: Create a standalone, unified Main GUI for VUI
  - Design a centralized configuration framework that all modules can hook into
  - Implement a consistent styling and navigation system
  - Ensure configuration panel loads efficiently without bloating memory usage
  
- **High Priority**: Module Configuration Integration
  - Remove individual module configuration panels (except VUIGfinder)
  - Integrate all module options into the main configuration system
  - Ensure each module has a dedicated section with appropriate categorization
  - Maintain all existing configuration options without feature loss
  - Preserve VUIGfinder's unique configuration tied to the LFG interface
  
- **High Priority**: First-Time Installation Experience
  - Design streamlined installation wizard for new users
  - Create step-by-step guide for essential configuration options
  - Implement default profiles for different user types (DPS, Tank, Healer)
  - Add tooltips and help text for all configuration options
  - Include welcome message with basic navigation instructions

#### Implementation Plan
1. **Analysis Phase** (1-2 days)
   - Audit all existing module configuration systems
   - Document all configuration options that need to be preserved
   - Identify common patterns and shared requirements

2. **Architecture Design** (2-3 days)
   - Design modular configuration framework
   - Create registration system for modules to hook into main GUI
   - Define standard API for modules to add configuration options

3. **Core Implementation** (3-4 days)
   - Build standalone configuration panel framework
   - Implement navigation and category system
   - Create option templates (sliders, checkboxes, color pickers, etc.)
   - Develop consistent styling system

4. **Module Integration** (4-5 days)
   - Convert each module to use the new configuration system
   - Migrate all settings without data loss
   - Test each module for full functionality

5. **Installation Wizard** (2-3 days)
   - Design and implement first-time setup experience
   - Create guided configuration process
   - Add default profile selection

6. **Testing & Refinement** (2-3 days)
   - Usability testing for configuration flow
   - Performance testing to ensure minimal impact
   - Polish and refine user experience

## Upcoming Phases

### ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Testing, Debugging, and Performance Optimization
- **To Do**: Testing module compatibility with current game version
- **To Do**: Refining error handling for better troubleshooting
- **To Do**: Optimizing performance for high-stress situations (raids, etc.)
- **To Do**: Memory usage optimization
- **To Do**: Load-time improvements

### ðŸ”„ Phase 6: Documentation and Release Preparation
- **Completed**: README.md creation
- **Completed**: CHANGELOG.md updates
- **Completed**: ROADMAP.md progress tracking
- **To Do**: In-game help system enhancements
- **To Do**: Final packaging for distribution
- **To Do**: Release version preparation

## Development Philosophy Changes

Based on user preferences, the following changes were made to the development approach:

1. **Test Framework Removal**: Eliminated TestFramework.lua and all Test.lua files in favor of direct in-game error reporting for more transparent debugging.

2. **Media Directory Standardization**: Consolidated all media assets in the uppercase "Media" directory for cross-OS compatibility and consistent references.

3. **Temporary File Cleanup**: Removed all temporary files and directories used during development to streamline the final package.

4. **Configuration System Redesign**: Shifting from distributed configuration panels to a single, unified configuration system while preserving all functionality.

## Next Steps

The immediate focus is on implementing the Configuration System Overhaul (Phase 4.5), with particular attention to:

1. Creating a standalone Main GUI that all modules connect to
2. Consolidating module configuration panels while maintaining all options
3. Improving the first-time installation experience

Upon completion of the Configuration System Overhaul, work will continue on Phase 5 (Testing, Debugging, and Performance Optimization).
