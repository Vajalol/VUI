- **In Progress**: Refining error handling for better troubleshooting
- **To Do**: Optimizing performance for high-stress situations (raids, etc.)
- **To Do**: Memory usage optimization
- **To Do**: Load-time improvements

### ðŸ”„ Phase 6: Documentation and Release Preparation
- **Completed**: README.md creation
- **Completed**: CHANGELOG.md updates
- **Completed**: ROADMAP.md progress tracking
- **To Do**: In-game help system enhancements
- **To Do**: Final packaging for distribution
- **To Do**: Release version preparation

## Development Philosophy Changes

Based on user preferences, the following changes were made to the development approach:

1. **Test Framework Removal**: Eliminated TestFramework.lua and all Test.lua files in favor of direct in-game error reporting for more transparent debugging.

2. **Media Directory Standardization**: Consolidated all media assets in the uppercase "Media" directory for cross-OS compatibility and consistent references.

3. **Temporary File Cleanup**: Removed all temporary files and directories used during development to streamline the final package.

## Next Steps

The immediate focus is on Phase 5 (Testing, Debugging, and Performance Optimization), with particular attention to:

1. Comprehensive error handling without masking issues
2. Performance testing in various in-game scenarios
3. Memory usage monitoring and optimization
4. Final polish of the user interface and experience

Upon completion of Phase 5, work will begin on Phase 6 to prepare for the initial public release.
