## Completed Phases

### âœ… Phase 0: Foundation and Initial Setup
- Created development environment
- Cloned SUI repository as base
- Completed rebranding from SUI to VUI
- Established directory structure
- Set up version control with Git

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Addon Module Integration
- Integrated all 10 required addon modules:
  - VUIBuffs (from buff-overlay)
  - VUIAnyFrame (from MoveAny)
  - VUIKeystones (from Angry Keystones)
  - VUICC (from OmniCC)
  - VUICD (from OmniCD - Party Cooldown Tracker)
  - VUIIDs (from idTip)
  - VUIGfinder (from PremadeGroupFinder)
  - VUITGCD (from TrufiGCD)
  - VUIAuctionator (from Auctionator)
  - VUINotifications (from SpellNotifications)

### âœ… Phase 2: WeakAura Feature Replication
- Implemented all 5 required WeakAura-derived modules:
  - VUIConsumables (from Luxthos - Consumables)
  - VUIPositionOfPower (from Position of Power)
  - VUIMissingRaidBuffs (from Missing Raid Buffs)
  - VUIMouseFireTrail (from Frogski's mouse fire trail)
  - VUIHealerMana (from Healer Mana)

### âœ… Phase 3: VUI Plater
- Created comprehensive nameplate customization system
- Replicated Whiiskeyz Plater profile appearance and functionality
- Integrated all necessary textures and visuals
- Implemented dynamic nameplate behavior for different unit types

### âœ… Phase 4: UI/UX Unification and Configuration Panel
- Created enhanced configuration panel with organized categories
- Implemented Animation.lua utility for smooth transitions and effects
- Standardized media directory structure (using uppercase "Media")
- Consolidated all module configurations into unified panel
- Removed TestFramework.lua in favor of direct in-game debugging

## Priority Tasks - Configuration System Enhancement

### ðŸ”´ Phase 4.5: Configuration System Enhancement
- **High Priority**: Expand Existing GUI System
  - Ensure all modules properly hook into the current GUI system
  - Add any missing configuration options for complete functionality
  - Maintain the existing GUI architecture while enhancing it
  
- **High Priority**: Module Configuration Standardization
  - Keep VUIGfinder's unique configuration tied to the LFG interface
  - Connect all other modules to the main configuration panel
  - Organize options logically with appropriate categorization
  - Ensure all functionality is accessible through the main GUI
  
- **High Priority**: First-Time User Experience
  - Improve the initial user experience for new installations
  - Provide better default configurations
  - Add helpful tooltips and explanations for key features
  - Include streamlined default profile options

#### Implementation Plan
1. **GUI System Analysis**
   - Study the existing configuration system architecture
   - Identify how modules currently register with the main GUI
   - Document best practices for adding options without breaking existing functionality
   
2. **Module Connection & Enhancement**
   - Systematically add any missing module options to the main configuration panel
   - Standardize how modules register their configuration sections
   - Ensure all modules properly save and load settings
   
3. **First-Time Experience Improvements**
   - Enhance the installation/first-run experience
   - Create sensible defaults for all options
   - Add helpful guidance for new users

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Verify all configuration options work correctly
   - Test settings persistence between sessions
   - Ensure consistent user experience across all modules

## Upcoming Phases

### ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Testing, Debugging, and Performance Optimization
- **To Do**: Testing module compatibility with current game version
- **To Do**: Refining error handling for better troubleshooting
- **To Do**: Optimizing performance for high-stress situations (raids, etc.)
- **To Do**: Memory usage optimization
- **To Do**: Load-time improvements

### ðŸ”„ Phase 6: Documentation and Release Preparation
- **Completed**: README.md creation
- **Completed**: CHANGELOG.md updates
- **Completed**: ROADMAP.md progress tracking
- **To Do**: In-game help system enhancements
- **To Do**: Final packaging for distribution
- **To Do**: Release version preparation

## Development Philosophy Changes

Based on user preferences, the following changes were made to the development approach:

1. **Test Framework Removal**: Eliminated TestFramework.lua and all Test.lua files in favor of direct in-game error reporting for more transparent debugging.

2. **Media Directory Standardization**: Consolidated all media assets in the uppercase "Media" directory for cross-OS compatibility and consistent references.

3. **Temporary File Cleanup**: Removed all temporary files and directories used during development to streamline the final package.

4. **Configuration System Enhancement**: Extending the existing configuration system to ensure all modules are properly integrated while maintaining the current architecture.

## Next Steps

The immediate focus is on enhancing the Configuration System (Phase 4.5), with particular attention to:

1. Expanding the existing GUI system with complete module configuration options
2. Ensuring all modules properly connect to the main configuration panel
3. Improving the first-time user experience with better defaults and guidance

Upon completion of the Configuration System Enhancement, work will continue on Phase 5 (Testing, Debugging, and Performance Optimization).
