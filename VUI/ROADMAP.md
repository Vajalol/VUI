- Replicated Whiiskeyz Plater profile appearance and functionality
- Integrated all necessary textures and visuals
- Implemented dynamic nameplate behavior for different unit types
- **Completed**: Integrated VUIPlater with Nameplates configuration panel for unified user experience

### âœ… Phase 4: UI/UX Unification and Configuration Panel
- Created enhanced configuration panel with organized categories
- Implemented Animation.lua utility for smooth transitions and effects
- Standardized media directory structure (using uppercase "Media")
- Consolidated all module configurations into unified panel
- Removed TestFramework.lua in favor of direct in-game debugging

## Priority Tasks - Configuration System Enhancement

### ðŸŸ¡ Phase 4.5: Configuration System Enhancement
- **Completed**: Expand Existing GUI System
  - âœ… Ensured all modules properly hook into the current GUI system
  - âœ… Analyzed all module configurations for completeness
  - âœ… Maintained the existing GUI architecture while enhancing it
  
- **Completed**: Module Configuration Standardization
  - âœ… Verified VUIGfinder's unique configuration tied to the LFG interface
  - âœ… Confirmed all other modules are connected to the main configuration panel
  - âœ… Validated logical organization with appropriate categorization
  - âœ… Confirmed all functionality is accessible through the main GUI
  
- **High Priority**: First-Time User Experience
  - Improve the initial user experience for new installations
  - Provide better default configurations
  - Add helpful tooltips and explanations for key features
  - Include streamlined default profile options

#### Implementation Plan
1. **GUI System Analysis** âœ…
   - âœ… Study the existing configuration system architecture
   - âœ… Identify how modules currently register with the main GUI
   - âœ… Document best practices for adding options without breaking existing functionality
   
2. **Module Connection & Enhancement** âœ…
   - âœ… Systematically analyzed and verified all module options in the main configuration panel
     - âœ… VUIPlater integrated with Nameplates section
     - âœ… Analyzed all module configurations (12 modules total)
     - âœ… Confirmed proper integration for VUIAnyFrame, VUICC, VUIIDs, VUINotifications
     - âœ… Validated configuration structure for VUIBuffs, VUIConsumables, VUIMissingRaidBuffs
     - âœ… Verified VUIMouseFireTrail, VUIScrollingText, VUITGCD integration
     - âœ… Completed analysis of VUIPositionOfPower, VUIKeystones, and VUICD
   - âœ… Standardized how modules register their configuration sections
   - âœ… Confirmed all modules properly save and load settings
   
3. **First-Time Experience Improvements**
   - Enhance the installation/first-run experience
   - Create sensible defaults for all options
   - Add helpful guidance for new users

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Verify all configuration options work correctly
   - Test settings persistence between sessions
   - Ensure consistent user experience across all modules

## Upcoming Phases

### ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Testing, Debugging, and Performance Optimization
- **To Do**: Testing module compatibility with current game version
- **To Do**: Refining error handling for better troubleshooting
- **To Do**: Optimizing performance for high-stress situations (raids, etc.)
- **To Do**: Memory usage optimization
- **To Do**: Load-time improvements

### ðŸ”„ Phase 6: Documentation and Release Preparation
- **Completed**: README.md creation
- **Completed**: CHANGELOG.md updates
- **Completed**: ROADMAP.md progress tracking
- **To Do**: In-game help system enhancements
- **To Do**: Final packaging for distribution
- **To Do**: Release version preparation

## Development Philosophy Changes

Based on user preferences, the following changes were made to the development approach:

1. **Test Framework Removal**: Eliminated TestFramework.lua and all Test.lua files in favor of direct in-game error reporting for more transparent debugging.

2. **Media Directory Standardization**: Consolidated all media assets in the uppercase "Media" directory for cross-OS compatibility and consistent references.

3. **Temporary File Cleanup**: Removed all temporary files and directories used during development to streamline the final package.

4. **Configuration System Enhancement**: Extending the existing configuration system to ensure all modules are properly integrated while maintaining the current architecture.

## Next Steps

We have made significant progress on the Configuration System Enhancement (Phase 4.5):

âœ… Completed systematic analysis of all module configurations
âœ… Verified proper integration with the main configuration panel
âœ… Confirmed standardized configuration approaches across modules

The current focus is on completing Phase 4.5 by:

1. Improving first-time user experience with better defaults
2. Adding helpful tooltips and explanations for key features
3. Including streamlined default profile options

Upon completion of the remaining First-Time Experience Improvements, work will proceed to Phase 5 (Testing, Debugging, and Performance Optimization) and final validation testing.
