# Sound Files

This directory contains sound files used by various modules in the VUI addon.

## Required Files
- `spell_notification.ogg` - Used by the SpellNotifications module for ability procs
- Various other module-specific sound files

Important note: For the WoW client to properly recognize sound files, they need to be in OGG format. MP3 files typically do not work correctly in the WoW addon environment.

## Sound Files Description
- **spell_notification.ogg**: A clear, distinct sound that plays when an important spell or ability is triggered. The sound is designed to be noticeable but not overpowering, with a magical quality that fits all four themes of the addon.
