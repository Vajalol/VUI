# Icon Files

This directory contains icons used by various modules in the VUI addon.

## Required Files
- `plus.svg` - Used by the BuffOverlay module for healer identification
- `plus.tga` - TGA version of the healer icon (needs to be converted from SVG)
- `vortex.svg` - Main VUI addon icon representing the Vortex brand
- `vortex.tga` - TGA version of the main VUI icon (needs to be converted from SVG)

The TGA files need to be properly converted from SVG to ensure correct rendering in the game.

## Icon Descriptions
- **Vortex Icon**: Represents the primary branding for the VUI addon suite, featuring a stylized spiral vortex design with a blue-to-purple gradient that matches our Thunder Storm and Arcane Mystic themes. This icon appears in the addon list, minimap button, and configuration panels.
