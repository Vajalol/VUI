# Missing Texture: threat.tga

The following file is referenced in the nameplate module but is missing:

- `threat.tga` - Used by the nameplates module for threat indication

This file needs to be sourced from the original addon or created as a TGA file:
- Location: `media/threat.tga`
- Referenced in: `modules/nameplates/hooks.lua`

For proper visualization, this texture should be created in TGA format with alpha channel support.
