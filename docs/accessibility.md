# VUI - Accessibility Enhancement System

## Overview

The Accessibility Enhancement System provides a comprehensive set of features to make VUI more accessible to all players, with particular focus on those with visual impairments, motor skill limitations, or color vision deficiencies. This system allows players to customize the UI to meet their specific accessibility needs.

## Core Features

### 1. High Contrast Mode

High Contrast Mode enhances the visibility of UI elements by increasing the contrast between foreground and background elements, making text and UI components easier to distinguish.

#### Key Capabilities:
- **Adjustable Contrast Levels**: Low, Medium, and High settings to accommodate different needs
- **Selective Enhancement**: Apply contrast to backgrounds, borders, text, and icons independently
- **Theme Integration**: Automatically generates high-contrast versions of all themes
- **Font Enhancement**: Increases text boldness and clarity for better readability

#### Implementation Details:
- Creates modified versions of existing themes with enhanced contrast
- Processes colors based on luminance to ensure optimal visibility
- Applies contrast transformations consistently across all UI elements
- Custom color processing for different UI components based on their function

### 2. UI Scaling Options

UI Scaling provides flexible options to adjust the size of UI elements, making them easier to see and interact with on various display resolutions.

#### Key Capabilities:
- **Global UI Scaling**: Adjust the size of all UI elements simultaneously
- **Module-Specific Scaling**: Set different scaling factors for individual modules
- **Automatic Resolution Scaling**: Intelligently adapts UI size based on screen resolution
- **Persistent Settings**: UI scale preferences are maintained across sessions

#### Implementation Details:
- Uses WoW's native scaling systems for compatibility
- Implements custom frame scaling for module-specific adjustments
- Stores original scale values for perfect restoration
- Optimizes scale calculations to maintain visual clarity

### 3. Colorblind Mode

Colorblind Mode optimizes the UI for players with various types of color vision deficiencies, ensuring critical information is not solely dependent on color differentiation.

#### Key Capabilities:
- **Multiple Colorblind Types**: Support for Protanopia (red-blind), Deuteranopia (green-blind), and Tritanopia (blue-blind)
- **Adjustable Intensity**: Control the strength of colorblind adjustments
- **Text Labels**: Add text identifiers to color-coded elements
- **Pattern Differentiation**: Apply distinct patterns to help distinguish between similar colors

#### Implementation Details:
- Color transformation algorithms simulate the appearance for different types of colorblindness
- Automatic recalculation of theme colors to maintain readability
- Integration with all VUI modules to ensure consistent colorblind support
- Support for WoW's built-in colorblind features

### 4. Keyboard Navigation Enhancement

Keyboard Navigation improvements make the addon more accessible to players who have difficulty using a mouse or prefer keyboard interaction.

#### Key Capabilities:
- **Tab Indexing**: Navigate through UI elements using the Tab key
- **Hotkey Visibility**: Clearly displays keyboard shortcuts on buttons
- **Arrow Key Navigation**: Use arrow keys to move between UI elements
- **ESC Key Integration**: Close windows in reverse opening order with the ESC key

#### Implementation Details:
- Custom focus management system for consistent navigation
- Enhanced visibility of keyboard shortcuts throughout the UI
- Logical tab order based on UI layout and element importance
- Integration with WoW's native keyboard navigation systems

### 5. Audio Feedback Options

Audio Feedback provides sound cues to supplement visual information, helping players with visual impairments and enhancing the overall user experience.

#### Key Capabilities:
- **Button Sounds**: Audio feedback when interacting with buttons
- **Alert Sounds**: Distinct sounds for different types of alerts and warnings
- **Narrative Tooltips**: Optional audio description of tooltip content

#### Implementation Details:
- Custom sound library for consistent audio cues
- Volume and type controls for different sound categories
- Integration with external narration addons for advanced audio feedback
- Conditional sound playback based on UI context

### 6. Profile Management

Profile Management allows players to save and load different accessibility configurations for different characters, specializations, or situations.

#### Key Capabilities:
- **Named Profiles**: Save complete sets of accessibility settings
- **Quick Switching**: Easily switch between different accessibility configurations
- **Automatic Profile Switching**: Automatically apply profiles based on character or specialization
- **Profile Sharing**: Export and import accessibility profiles (planned for future update)

#### Implementation Details:
- Comprehensive profile storage system
- Character and specialization detection for automatic switching
- Profile metadata including name, description, and application rules
- Database integration for persistent storage

## Integration with VUI Modules

The Accessibility system is deeply integrated with all VUI modules, ensuring consistent support across the entire addon suite:

- **MultiNotification**: Enhanced high-contrast alerts and colorblind-friendly notification icons
- **BuffOverlay**: Text indicators for colorblind mode and scaling options
- **TrufiGCD**: Alternative visualization options and high-contrast tracking
- **OmniCD**: Colorblind-friendly cooldown displays with pattern differentiation
- **DetailsSkin**: High-contrast graphs and colorblind-optimized data visualization

## Configuration

All accessibility features can be configured through the VUI settings panel under the "Accessibility" tab. The configuration options are organized into logical sections:

1. **High Contrast Mode**: Toggle options and contrast level adjustments
2. **UI Scaling**: Global and module-specific scaling controls
3. **Colorblind Mode**: Type selection and intensity controls
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Navigation method preferences
5. **Audio Feedback**: Sound type and volume controls
6. **Profile Management**: Save, load, and automatic profile controls

## Best Practices for Addon Developers

When extending VUI with custom modules, follow these guidelines to maintain accessibility:

1. **Use VUI's accessibility API**: Integrate with the main accessibility system through provided hooks
2. **Support all accessibility modes**: Ensure your module works with all accessibility features
3. **Test with accessibility features**: Verify functionality with different combinations of settings
4. **Provide alternative information channels**: Don't rely solely on color, visual elements, or mouse interaction
5. **Use standard UI patterns**: Maintain consistency with VUI's accessibility-enhanced patterns

## Implementation Example

To make a custom module fully accessible:

```lua
-- Register for accessibility updates
function MyModule:Initialize()
    -- Normal initialization
    ...
    
    -- Register for accessibility notifications
    VUI:RegisterModuleFunction(self, "OnHighContrastModeChanged", self.UpdateContrast)
    VUI:RegisterModuleFunction(self, "OnColorblindModeChanged", self.UpdateColors)
    VUI:RegisterModuleFunction(self, "OnUIScalingChanged", self.UpdateScale)
    VUI:RegisterModuleFunction(self, "OnKeyboardNavigationChanged", self.UpdateKeyboardNav)
    VUI:RegisterModuleFunction(self, "OnAudioFeedbackChanged", self.UpdateSounds)
    VUI:RegisterModuleFunction(self, "OnAccessibilitySettingsChanged", self.RefreshAll)
end

-- Implement handlers for each accessibility feature
function MyModule:UpdateContrast(enabled, level)
    -- Apply high contrast mode
    ...
end

function MyModule:UpdateColors(enabled, colorblindType, intensity)
    -- Apply colorblind adjustments
    ...
end

-- And so on for other features
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Motion Sensitivity Options**: Reduce or disable animations for players with motion sensitivity
2. **Voice Command Integration**: Support for voice commands through external tools
3. **Expanded Keyboard Control**: Full keyboard control for all addon functions
4. **Focus Mode**: Simplified UI with emphasis on essential elements
5. **Contextual Assistance**: Intelligent help system that adapts to player behavior
