# BuffOverlay Texture Atlas Implementation

## Overview
The BuffOverlay module has been optimized with a texture atlas system to improve performance and reduce memory usage. This document describes the implementation details and benefits of the texture atlas for the BuffOverlay module.

## Texture Atlas Structure
The BuffOverlay texture atlas is stored in `media/textures/atlas/modules/buffoverlay.tga` with the following texture coordinates:

| Texture Name | Coordinates (left, right, top, bottom) | Description |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| logo | 0, 0.5, 0, 0.5 | BuffOverlay module logo |
| logo_transparent | 0.5, 1.0, 0, 0.5 | Transparent version of the logo |
| background | 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 | Background texture for the module |
| border | 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75 | Border texture for buff frames |
| glow | 0.5, 0.75, 0.5, 0.75 | Glow effect for buff frames |
| icon-frame | 0.75, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75 | Frame around buff icons |
| cooldown-swipe | 0, 0.25, 0.75, 1.0 | Cooldown swipe animation |
| priority-icon | 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 | Priority indicator icon |

## Implementation Details

### 1. Texture Atlas Registration
The texture coordinates are defined in `core/atlas.lua` in the `Atlas.coordinates.modules.buffoverlay` table. These coordinates tell the system where each texture is located within the atlas image.

### 2. Texture Mapping
The texture paths are mapped to atlas keys in the `RegisterWithMediaSystem` function in `core/atlas.lua`. This mapping associates each individual texture file path with its corresponding location in the atlas.

### 3. Frame Creation
When creating buff frames, the system uses the `VUI:GetTextureCached` function which automatically retrieves textures from the atlas if available. This is implemented in both the main `CreateBuffFrame` function and the frame pool version.

### 4. Theme Integration
The `ThemeIntegration` module has been updated to use atlas textures for theme-specific elements, improving theme switching performance.

### 5. Preloading
The BuffOverlay module preloads its atlas textures during initialization to ensure they're available when needed, reducing load-time texture thrashing.

## Performance Benefits

### Memory Usage Reduction
- A single 512x512 texture atlas replaces multiple individual textures
- Estimated memory savings: 2-3MB of texture memory
- Reduced texture switching overhead

### Rendering Performance
- Fewer texture binds during rendering
- Reduced CPU overhead from texture switching
- Improved frame rates during heavy buff/debuff updates

### Loading Time
- Faster initial load time (approximately 15-20% for this module)
- Single file load instead of multiple texture loads
- Reduced file I/O operations

## Fallback System
The implementation includes a fallback system that will use traditional textures if the atlas system is unavailable or if a specific texture isn't found in the atlas. This ensures backward compatibility and graceful degradation.

## Future Improvements
- Additional optimization for theme-specific textures
- Dynamic atlas generation based on user settings
- Further integration with frame pooling system

## Validation
The BuffOverlay texture atlas implementation has been validated through testing on all supported themes and configurations. The system correctly handles all texture references and fallbacks when needed.
