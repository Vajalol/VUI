Adds additional information to the Mythic Keystone objective tracker. 

### Bonus Chest Timer

Adds a secondary timer next to main one to show time left for bonus chests. Shows in gold for time for 2 bonus chest, and in silver for time for 1 bonus chest. It also adds a line on the timer bar to mark when this will occur.

### Extended Progress Bar

Shows more exact information on how much Enemies Forces progress is needed. Either displaying it as a more exact percent (24.19%) or as a numerical value (90/372), or both. Will also show on enemy tooltips how much progress they each give, after killing them once to learn how much progress they give.

### Death Tracker

Will show an icon in the objective tracker with total number of deaths for the current run. Hover over it for a tooltip to show a breakdown of deaths per player, and the total time lost. It won't count deaths very far away from you that didn't show in the combat log.

### Keystone Linking

Replaces Keystones links you see in chat from [Mythic Keystone] to [Keystone: The Arcway - Level 5], will also color it grey if it is depleted.

### Auto Gossip

During Mythic Keystone dungeons it will automatically select gossip entries for you. For example for starting Odyn and his trash, and Court of Stars buff objects.

Also has an option to output the clue from Chatty Rumormongers to party chat during the Court of Stars event. Currently only available for English locales.

### Options

Configuration options can be accessed with /akeys, or in the addon interface options panel. There is an option for auto gossip, format of progress bar, and whether to show progress value on enemy tooltips.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Can you disable hiding the objective tracker during boss battles?**

This is caused by another addon, likely DBM, hiding the tracker during boss battles. To disable this, uncheck the "Hide watch (objective) frame during boss fights..." in the "Blizzard Disable & Hide" area of DBM settings.
