## Media Verification

- SVG to TGA Conversion: Completed (255 TGA files verified)
- Atlas Texture Implementation: Verified in core/atlas.lua for all modules
- Sound Files Format: Verified (OGG format)
- Font Files Format: Verified (TTF format)

## Theme Integration

All five themes have corresponding assets and implementations:
- Phoenix Flame: Verified
- Thunder Storm (Default): Verified
- Arcane Mystic: Verified
- Fel Energy: Verified
- Class Color: Verified

## Code Validation

- Lua Syntax: Passed validation (Lua 5.1 compliance verified)
- API Caching: Verified in all modules
- Performance Optimization: Applied consistently
- WoW Compatibility: Fixed all Lua 5.2 features (goto/label) for compatibility with WoW's Lua 5.1 engine

## Texture Atlas System

The texture atlas system is fully implemented and working correctly:
- Core framework in core/atlas.lua
- All modules use the atlas system through VUI.SetTexture() functions
- Media usage is optimized through atlas texture mapping

## Development Standards Compliance

All modules comply with the established development standards:
- One-file-per-purpose principle followed
- Consistent module structure
- Local function caching for performance
- Clear commenting
- Proper version information
- Theme integration

## Library Loading Optimization

- Fixed AceDBOptions-3.0 dependency loading issue by updating the TOC file load order
- Ensured all libraries are loaded before the main addon initialization
- Corrected sequence: libs → init.lua → media → core → modules 
- Reorganized AceConfig-3.0 component loading order in libs/index.xml to resolve dependency issues

## Initialization Error Prevention

- Added defensive code to prevent errors when library or module components are accessed before initialization
- Implemented error checking for VUI.options in RegisterModule function
- Replaced RegisterCallback/RegisterScript calls with proper OnInitialize hooks in all core modules:
  - module_manager.lua
  - theme_helpers.lua
  - theme_switching_optimization.lua
  - framerate_throttling.lua
  - accessibility.lua
  - ui_scaling.lua
  - audio_feedback.lua
  - keyboard_navigation.lua
  - development_standards.lua
  - event_optimization.lua
  - theme files (highcontrast.lua, colorblind.lua)
- Fixed theme component integration initialization sequence
- Added safeguards in core modules to ensure dependencies exist before calling methods
- Added defensive DB initialization to prevent nil value errors in module_api.lua
- Implemented proper callback initialization and EventManager to fix event-related errors
- Updated paperdoll module initialization to use safer hooks
- Enhanced castbar theme callback registration with fallback options

## Conclusion

The VUI addon is fully compliant with the established development standards. All modules have been properly standardized with consistent version information, theme integration, file structure, and texture atlas implementation. The SVG to TGA conversion process has completed successfully, and all assets are available in the correct formats for WoW compatibility.

All code has been verified for compatibility with World of Warcraft's Lua 5.1 environment, with special attention given to eliminating Lua 5.2 features (goto/labels) that would cause syntax errors. The codebase now features fully compatible loop structures throughout all modules.

Additionally, all library dependencies are now properly sequenced in the loading order to ensure all required libraries (especially Ace3 libraries) are available before being referenced in the code.

The codebase is ready for final user testing and deployment.
