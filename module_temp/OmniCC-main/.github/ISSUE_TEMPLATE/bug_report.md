**Give us a clear and concise description of the problem, and what you expect to happen**

Screenshots can help quite a bit.

**Do you have any steps to reproduce this issue?**

The best way for us to fix an issue is to know how to reproduce it.

**Are you getting any error messages?**

World of Warcraft disables errors by default. Install [BugSack](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bugsack) or addon error messages via `/console scriptErrors 1` and reload the game. If an error window appears, write here the first message (labelled 1/Many) that appeared. If you're getting especially low FPS, it probably means that you're getting a bunch of errors that are hidden.

**What version of OmniCC are you running?**

You can get this via the slash command `/omnicc version`. If you're not running the latest release, please try that version first.

**What version of World of Warcraft are you on?**

You can get this via the command, `/dump GetBuildInfo()`.

**What other addons are you running?**

Lot of times, OmniCC issues are AddOn specific.
