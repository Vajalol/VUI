# VUI: A Comprehensive Development Roadmap (Updated)

## 1. Introduction & Project Vision

This document outlines the development roadmap for **VUI**, a new, massive, and unified addon suite designed for the retail version of World of Warcraft. The primary goal of VUI is to meticulously consolidate the functionality, aesthetics, and media assets of several well-regarded existing addons and WeakAuras into a single, cohesive, and high-quality package. The project will be authored by "VortexQ8" and will utilize the SUI addon (`https://github.com/Syiana/SUI`) as its foundational codebase. VUI aims to be a meticulously crafted suite, ensuring that no features from the original components are overlooked, and that the final product is both powerful and user-friendly.

## 2. Phase 0: Foundation and Initial Setup âœ… COMPLETED

This initial phase focuses on preparing the development environment, acquiring the base codebase, performing the initial rebranding, and establishing the core directory structure for VUI.

### Step 0.1: Environment Setup âœ…
Development environment successfully configured with appropriate tools for WoW addon development.

### Step 0.2: Clone SUI Repository âœ…

### Step 0.5: Version Control âœ…
Git repository initialized and baseline structure committed.
