This is a placeholder file for the CustomTextures.blp file that would contain the actual texture artwork.

In a real implementation, these would be BLP (Blizzard Texture Format) files that contain the graphical elements for the custom player frames.

The artwork would include:
1. Base frame textures for different classes
2. Custom frame elements like dragon wings, rare silver borders, etc.
3. Different resolution versions for UI scaling (normal and 2x for high resolution displays)

For a full implementation, these texture files would need to be created by a graphic artist familiar with World of Warcraft's UI styling and exported in the appropriate format.
